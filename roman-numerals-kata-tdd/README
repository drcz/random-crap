A second cool TDD workshop, muchas gracias Rub√©n!

http://www.meetup.com/Software-Craftsmanship-Alicante/events/231243485/

[eureka](eureka.scm)
 -- done ``the old way'', before the workshop;

[kata1](kata1.scm) (to be read simultainously with [kata1-test.scm](https://github.com/drcz/random-crap/blob/master/roman-numerals-kata-tdd/kata1-test.scm) )
 -- first 70 lines report what we did, then follows what we wanted to do.

[final-strange-thing](final-strange-thing.scm)
 -- ``final version'' (probably should go in some other direction...) extracted from kata1.scm
