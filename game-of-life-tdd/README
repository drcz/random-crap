Yesterday I was on global day of coderetreat; it was awesome, no only because they had coffee and pizza!
After coming back home I tried following the rules of tdd in scheme with geiser.
Despite being prepared, it felt strange, but actually turned out to be useful (I did some silly mistakes while writing this, which turned out immediately).
This is the first iteration, moslty for our great faciliator, who was curious.
Muchas gracias Jorge!

Perhaps it would be useful to write some macros for embedding the tests in the code itself;
but for now I found it cool to split emacs into 2 columns, with test code on the left and implementation on the right.

Today I wrote a small demo life-display.scm for it, which can be run with guile-2.0 (requires ncurses module);
it initializes with B-heptomino (some more cool patterns I found here http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Methuselah).
press any key to stop.

We'll see how this tdd thing works with serious projects...


PS oh-oh, I forgot! You also need a nice-9 module (whis is pretty awesome) by Panicz Godek, the Grand Schemer;
I attach it for completeness -- just place it in ice-9 modules (probably /usr/share/guile/2.0/ice-9/).

Current version is available in his slayer project (which is awesome as well, check it out especially if you want to write games in scheme):
https://bitbucket.org/panicz/slayer/src/ -- here (guile-modules/ice-9).
